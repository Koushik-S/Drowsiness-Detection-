# Drowsiness-Detection-
The objective of this project is to develop a computer vision model to detect if a person is attentive or not. The model when implemented takes the image of face of the person and using convolutional neural network based model, predicts the attention status of the person.

This project is done as part of a course and the model used here is very basic and can be improved in many folds and I will update this later
